With schools closed and time at home, I discovered my passion for programming. What started as simple curiosity quickly turned into a serious commitment.Since entering university, I have devoted countless hours to improving my skills — learning from lecturers, YouTube tutorials, and various online resources. I challenged myself to build projects, solve coding problems, and dive deep into full-stack development. After nearly two years of consistent hard work, I am now confident in my ability to build complete web and mobile applications.I believe that coding is not just about writing lines of code but also about creativity, problem-solving, and continuous learning — values that drive me every day.",
